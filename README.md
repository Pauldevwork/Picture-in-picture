# Picture-in-picture
This app enables the user to play a video running on another tab (like youtube) using picture in picture.
It will stay on top of whatever window you are on, so if you are coding along with a tutorial or a function you do not fully understand it will stay on top as you click and write your code.

Or you might just be browsing the internet and want a podcast on!

Very handy project for a real world situation. 

Please use and enjoy!
